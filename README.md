# Objective-C-rowdSound

Once this repo is available locally, you need to install the various cocoapods listed in the Podfile. These are equivalent
to dependencies.

```
$ pod install
```

All the dependences will install (openSSL might take a really long time but thats okay). After this open the .xcworkspace file in Xcode and build the project.
